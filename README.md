# Flutter Vikings 2022 Theme Talk Demo

A simple Flutter ThemeData demo app used at Flutter Vikings 2022 theme talk.

This demo is made in a single `main.dart` file to be easy to run in DartPad. Link to its gist
version and DartPad will be added before the talk.

The demo requires Flutter 3.3.0, use beat channel with 3.3.0 for now.

It is also available as gist [here](https://gist.github.com/rydmike/6119077e4ba215f7eba87b785c06eaae).

To run it DartPad 3.3.0 use its beta channel version,
[here](https://dartpad.dev/?id=6119077e4ba215f7eba87b785c06eaae&channel=beta).

When Flutter 3.3.0 stable is release, this DartPad 
[stable link](https://dartpad.dev/?id=6119077e4ba215f7eba87b785c06eaae) should work too.
